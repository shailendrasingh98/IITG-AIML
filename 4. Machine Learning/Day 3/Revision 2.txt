                              Machine Learning - Revision
                             -----------------------------
1. What is Machine Learning?
Ans: The Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being 
explicitly programmed. IT is a subset of AI where we train the machines to learn 
from data that understand the underlying patterns and use it for predictions.
Making machines do the tasks that otherwise need human intelligence.

2. What are the 2 broad types of machine learning?
Ans: Supervised ML & Unsupervised ML

3. What are the different types of datasets that we discussed yesterday?
Ans: Structured(Eg: Excel data), 
     Unstructured(Images, Videos, Audios, Text) and 
     Semi-structured(JSON, XML) datasets.

4. When would you use supervised machine learning?
Ans: It is used whenever the historic dataset has labels in it. 

5. What are the other terms/names that can be used to refer to the label in a dataset?
Ans: Output/target variable/dependent variable

6. When would you use unsupervised machine learning, and what is the outcome of 
unsupervised ML technique?
Ans: It is used whenever the historic dataset doesn't have labels in it (i.e, when the 
historic dataset is unlabeled.
And the output of unsupervised ML is the grouping of data points into clusters. 
(i.e) similar data points would be grouped in one cluster, whereas the 
dissimilar ones would be grouped in different clusters.

7. What are the 2 types of supervised machine learning techniques?
Ans: Regression & Classification

8. When would you use regression & when would you use classification? Give examples.
Ans: Regression is used when the target variable is of a continuous numeric type.
Eg: Stock price, house price predictions, temperature predictions
     Classification is used when the target variable is of a categorical type.
Eg: Spam detection, Grades of students, Disease classification

9. State True/False. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning.
Ans: True

10. What are the different types of regression algorithms?
Ans: Linear and Non Linear regression algorithms

=====================================================================================
11. What is the name of the library in Python that is used for Machine Learning?
Ans: Scikit Learn

12. Why do we create X & y variables as part of the ML model-building process?
Ans: X contains all the features and y contains the label of the dataset.
It is necessary to create these variables to present the features and the label of
the dataset to the ML model clearly.

13. Is it mandatory to split the input dataset into train and test sets? If yes. Why?
Ans: Yes, because the model has to be tested with a separate set of data points other
than the ones used during the training phase to ensure a fair evaluation. 
Also, the data collection process is a tedious one that can also be expensive.

14. What are the different train: test ratios that we discussed?
Ans: 75:25, 80:20, 70:30, 60:40

15. Why is there a need for the ratio of the training dataset to be higher than that 
of testing dataset?
Ans: Because the higher the number of good-quality data points used for training
the model, the better the results will be.

16. Name the evaluation metrics that can be used for a Regression model.
Ans: RMSE(Root Mean Squared Error) (0 to infinity) and
     R2 Score/Coefficient of determination(0-1).

======================================================================================


When test and train root mean square error (RMSE) are high - underfitting ---> may be wrong algorithm (Not suitable for this dataset)

When test and train RMSE are in acceptable range (low) - appropriate 

When test root mean square error (rmse is high and train rmse is low  - overfitting ---> could be due to many things, 
1. Representation of data points in training and test (not proper representation of all the features),  For Eg. Like training data has 3 locations data while test has only 2.

2. Features might be correlated to each other
