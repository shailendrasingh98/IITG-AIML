                              Machine Learning - Revision
                             -----------------------------
1. What is Machine Learning?
Ans: Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being 
explicitly programmed. IT is a subset of AI where we train the machines to learn 
from data that understand the underlying patterns and use it for predictions.
Making machine do the task which otherwise need human intelligence.

2. What are the 2 broad types of machine learning?
Ans: Supervised ML & Unsupervised ML

3. What are the different types of datasets that we discussed yesterday?
Ans: Structured(Eg: Excel data), 
     Unstructured(Images, Videos, Audios, Text) and 
     Semi-structured(JSON, XML) datasets.

4. When would you use supervised machine learning?
Ans: It is used whenever the historic dataset has labels in it. 

5. What are the other terms/names that can be used to refer the label in a dataset?
Ans: output / target variable / dependant variable

6. When would you use unsupervised machine learning and what is the outcome of 
unsupervised ML technique?
Ans: It is used whenever the historic dataset doesn't have labels in it (i.e) when the 
historic dataset is unlabelled.
And the output of unsupervised ML is grouping of data points into clusters. 
(i.e) similar data points would be grouped in one cluster whereas the 
dissimilar ones would be grouped in different clusters.

7. What are the 2 types of supervised machine learning techniques?
Ans: Regression & Classification

8. When would you use regression & when would you use classification? Give examples.
Ans: Regression is used when the target variable is of continuous numeric type.
Eg: Stock price, house price predictions, temperature predictions
     Classification is used when the target variable is of categorical type.
Eg: Spam detection, Grades of students, Disease classification

9. State True/False. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning.
Ans: True

10. What are the different types of regression algorithms?
Ans: Linear and Non Linear regression algorithms

=====================================================================================
11. What is the name of the library in Python that is used for Machine Learning?
Ans: Scikit Learn

12. Why do we create X & y variables as part of the ML model building process?
Ans: X contains all the features and y contains the label of the dataset.
It is necessary to create these variables to present the features and the label of
the dataset to the ML model clearly.

13. Is it mandatory to split the input dataset into train and test sets? If, yes.Why?
Ans: Yes, because the model has to be tested with a separate set of data points other
than the ones used during the training phase to ensure a fair evaluation. 
Also, the data collection process is a tedious one that also can be expensive.

14. What are the different train:test ratios that we discussed?
Ans: 75:25, 80:20, 70:30, 60:40

15. Why is there a need for the ratio of training dataset to be higher than that 
of testing dataset?
Ans: Because the higher the number of good qulality data points used for training
the model, the better will be it's performance.

16. Name the evaluation metrics that can be used for a Regression model.
Ans: RMSE(Root Mean Squared Error) (0 to infinity) and
     R2 Score/Co-efficient of determination(0-1).

======================================================================================
17. How does correlation in the dataset affect regression?
Ans: Correlation between features is an issue while building a linear regression model.
Correlation co-ef values exist between -1 to +1;
wherein if corr co-ef value>0 --> +ve correlation
	if corr co-ef value<0 --> -ve correlation
        if corr co-ef value=0 --> no correlation
Since it is clear that real world features cannot exist without being correlated with 
each other, the correlation between features with values -0.6 to +0.6 is tolerated.

18. what is regularised regression? Name the regularised regression algorithms.
Ans: Ridge(L2 regularization), Lasso(L1 regularization) & ElasticNet are the 
regularised regression algorithms.
It is a technique used to address the overfitting problem in linear regression model
by adding a penalty term.

19. When you are building a regularised regression model, can you control the 
strength of the penalty applied to the loss function of the linear regression model?
Ans: Yes, through the alpha hyperparameter.

20. Explain overfitting, underfitting and appropriate model. 
Ans: Overfitting is when the model performs well on training data but not well on 
testing dataset.
Underfitting is when the model does not perform well on both the training and 
testing datasets.
Appropriate fit is when the model performs well on training dataset as well as the
testing dataset.
