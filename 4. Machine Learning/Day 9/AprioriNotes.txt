Apriori algorithm:

Objective : to find the 3 parameters of the Apriori algorithm 
           - Support, Lift and Confidence - between 2 items - Pizzas & Cokes

Scenario:

We have 1,000 customer transaction records with us. Out of these 1000
transactions, 100 transactions contain Coke.
While 150 transactions contain Pizza.
And of these 150 transactions, 50 transactions contain Coke as well.

Using this data, we are going to find the support, lift and confidence
values between Pizza and coke.

Support :

--> It is a parameter which tells about the popularity of an item.

Support(Pizza) = Total no. of transactions containing Pizza /
                  Total no of transactions
               = 150 /1000 = 0.15

Support (Coke) =  100 / 1000 = 0.1

Confidence : 

--> It is a parameter that tells us about the likelihood of one product 
being purchased when the other product is already bought.

Confidence (Coke -> Pizza) = No.of Transactions contain both Coke and
                             Pizza / No. of Transactions containing Pizza 

                            = 50 / 150  = 1/3 = 33.3 %

Lift : 

--> It is a parameter which refers to the increase in the ratio of sales 
of Coke when pizza has already been bought.


Lift(Coke -> Pizza) = Confidence(Coke->Pizza) /
                      Support (Pizza)
                    = 0.333/ 0.15
                    = 2.22

This value 2.22 actually indicates how many times the likelihood of 
buying pizza and coke together is more than that of the likelihood of buying
just the Pizza alone.

--> Higher the lift, higher the chances of the 2 items being bought together.
--> if the lift value <= 1, then it means that it is very much unlikely for
    the two items being bought together.
