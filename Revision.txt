                              Machine Learning - Revision
                             -----------------------------
1. What is Machine Learning?
Ans: The Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being 
explicitly programmed. IT is a subset of AI where we train the machines to learn 
from data that understand the underlying patterns and use it for predictions.
Making machines do the tasks that otherwise need human intelligence.

2. What are the 2 broad types of machine learning?
Ans: Supervised ML & Unsupervised ML

3. What are the different types of datasets that we discussed yesterday?
Ans: Structured(Eg: Excel data), 
     Unstructured(Images, Videos, Audios, Text) and 
     Semi-structured(JSON, XML) datasets.

4. When would you use supervised machine learning?
Ans: It is used whenever the historic dataset has labels in it. 

5. What are the other terms/names that can be used to refer to the label in a dataset?
Ans: Output/target variable/dependent variable

6. When would you use unsupervised machine learning, and what is the outcome of 
unsupervised ML technique?
Ans: It is used whenever the historic dataset doesn't have labels in it (i.e) when the 
historic dataset is unlabeled.
And the output of unsupervised ML is a grouping of data points into clusters. 
(i.e) similar data points would be grouped in one cluster, whereas the 
dissimilar ones would be grouped in different clusters.

7. What are the 2 types of supervised machine learning techniques?
Ans: Regression & Classification

8. When would you use regression & when would you use classification? Give examples.
Ans: Regression is used when the target variable is of a continuous numeric type.
E.g: Stock price, house price predictions, temperature predictions
     Classification is used when the target variable is of a categorical type.
E.g: Spam detection, Grades of students, Disease classification

9. State True/False. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning.
Ans: True

10. What are the different types of regression algorithms?
Ans: Linear and Non Linear regression algorithms
