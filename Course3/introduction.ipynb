    "### What is Numpy?\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy stands for Numeric Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is an open source library used primarily for mathematical operations in science and engineering appliacations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy is convenient for performing easy operations on multi-diamensional array and matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the core of the NumPy package, is the ndarray object. This encapsulates n-dimensional arrays of homogeneous data types, with many operations being performed in compiled code for performance. "
