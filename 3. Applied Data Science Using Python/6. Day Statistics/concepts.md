# Data Science Concepts

## Types of Distributions
1. **Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution)**
   - Symmetrical, bell-shaped curve.
   - Mean = Median = Mode.
   - Real-World Example: Predicting house prices, where the residuals often follow a normal distribution.

2. **Uniform Distribution**
   - All values have equal probability.
   - Real-World Example: Lottery systems, where each number has an equal chance of being drawn.

3. **Binomial Distribution**
   - Describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials.
   - Real-World Example: A/B testing for web page performance.

4. **Poisson Distribution**
   - Models the number of events in a fixed interval.
   - Real-World Example: Number of customer arrivals at a store in an hour.

5. **Exponential Distribution**
   - Describes the time between events in a Poisson process.
   - Real-World Example: Time until a system failure in a data center.

6. **Bernoulli Distribution**
   - Two possible outcomes, usually 0 and 1.
   - Real-World Example: A single coin toss.

7. **Log-Normal Distribution**
   - Skewed to the right, used for data that grows exponentially.
   - Real-World Example: Stock prices.

8. **Pareto Distribution**
   - Long tail, skewed to the right, often referred to as the "80/20 rule."
   - Real-World Example: Wealth distribution or cybersecurity attacks.

## Statistical Measures Describing the Shape of a Distribution
1. **Skewness**
   - Measures the asymmetry of the distribution.
   - Positive skew means a long tail on the right, negative skew means a long tail on the left.
   - Real-World Example: Income distribution is often positively skewed.

2. **Kurtosis**
   - Measures the tailedness of the distribution.
   - Leptokurtic distributions have heavy tails, platykurtic distributions have light tails.
   - Real-World Example: Stock market returns often exhibit leptokurtic behavior.

3. **Mean**
   - The arithmetic average, sensitive to outliers.
   - Real-World Example: Average house prices.

4. **Median**
   - The middle value, better for skewed distributions.
   - Real-World Example: Median income is often used instead of mean income.

5. **Mode**
   - The most frequently occurring value.
   - Real-World Example: Most popular product in a store.

6. **Variance**
   - Measures the spread of data around the mean.
   - Real-World Example: Product quality consistency in manufacturing.

7. **Standard Deviation**
   - The square root of variance, used to measure the spread in the same units as the data.
   - Real-World Example: Risk in financial portfolios.

8. **Range**
   - The difference between the maximum and minimum values.
   - Real-World Example: Daily temperature variations.

9. **Interquartile Range (IQR)**
   - The range between the first and third quartiles (middle 50% of the data).
   - Real-World Example: Spread of salaries in an organization.

10. **Percentiles**
   - Divides data into 100 equal parts to measure relative standing.
   - Real-World Example: Standardized test scores.
