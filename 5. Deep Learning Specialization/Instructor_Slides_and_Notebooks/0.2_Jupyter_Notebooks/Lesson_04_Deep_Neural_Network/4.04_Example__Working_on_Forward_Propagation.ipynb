During forward propagation, each layer performs a series of mathematical operations, such as matrix multiplications and activation functions, to transform the input and generate an output. This process allows the network to make predictions or perform computations based on the given input data.\n","\n","Let us understand how forward propagation works."],"metadata":{"id":"K2arIzBldvIH"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Steps to be followed:\n","1.
